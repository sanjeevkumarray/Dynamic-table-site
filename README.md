# Dynamic Table with Sorting

This project is a dynamic table built with **React.js** that allows users to add, edit, filter, and sort data. It supports columns of both "string" and "number" types, offering a flexible way to manage tabular data.

## Features

- **Add Custom Columns**: Create new columns of type "string" or "number" as needed.
- **Insert Rows**: Dynamically add rows, with each cell supporting array-based data (e.g., `["Apple", "Orange"]`).
- **Edit Cell Data**: Easily modify the content of individual cells.
- **Filter Rows**: Filter data based on the values in each column, especially useful for string columns.
- **Sort Numeric Data**: Sort rows in numeric columns with conditions like:
  - Greater than or equal to (`>=`)
  - Less than or equal to (`<=`)
